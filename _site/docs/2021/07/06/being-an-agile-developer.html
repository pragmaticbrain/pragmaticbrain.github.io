<p>Being an agile developer is not about attending standups, move cards in Jira or play planning poker. Those are just ceremonies.
They might be useful (or not), but itâ€™s not what I want to about in this post.
No, this post will be about how to <em>behave</em> and how to <em>think</em> as an agile developer.
There are three main areas that I will adress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figuring out what to build</li>
  <li>How to build software</li>
  <li>Making things better</li>
</ul>
