title: "Being an Agile Developer"
---
Being an agile developer is not about attending standups, move cards in Jira or play planning poker. Those are just ceremonies.
They might be useful (or not), but it's not what I want to about in this post.
No, this post will be about how to _behave_ and how to _think_ as an agile developer.
There are three main areas that I will adress:

* Figuring out what to build
* How to build software
* Making things better

# Figuring out what to build
